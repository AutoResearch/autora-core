    "f_0(x), f_1(x), ... f_n(x)\\, ,\n",

    "Key principles:\n",
    "1. The *pipeline passes the data unchanged* between the $f_i$. It is agnostic to the data which the\n",
    "functions require or return.\n",
    "2. The $f_i$ can *mutate the data*.\n",
    "3. The $f_i$ must be *compatible with one another*. It is on the user to ensure this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "By being agnostic about the data, the pipeline is extremely simple and flexible. To allow a new kind of data, it is\n",
    "only required to define the datatype (perhaps as a\n",
    "[python `dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)) and then start writing $f_i$ which use that\n",
    "dataclass as an input and output type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst it is possible to write $f_i$ which change the type of the data which pass through and still work as a\n",
    "pipeline, it is recommended to return the same type, so $\\mathrm{type}(x) = \\mathrm{type}(f_i(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate some pipelines which use simple and more complex datatypes, and some pipelines\n",
    "which have type-mutating $f_i$."
