    "# Building Mixture Experimentalists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing the State/Delta mechanism should support is making more complex experimentalists which combine others.\n",
    "One example which have been suggested by the AER group are a \"mixture experimentalist\" which weights the outputs of\n",
    "other experimentalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "How experimentalists are typically defined has a major impact on whether this kind of mixture experimentalist is easy\n",
    " or hard to implement. Since the research group is currently (August 2023) deciding how experimentalists should\n",
    " generally be defined, now seems a good time to look at the different basic options for standards & conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the discussion, here we've put together some examples based on some toy experimentalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of the Open Question\n",
    "The question has to do with whether \"additional data\" beyond the conditions are included in the same or a different\n",
    "data array.\n",
    " (\"Additional data\" are data which are generated by the experimentalist and potentially needed by another\n",
    " experimentalist down the line, but are not the conditions themselves).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two competing conventions are if an experimentalist returns some extra data:\n",
    "- They are included in the `conditions` array as additional columns, _or_\n",
    "- They are passed as a _different_ array alongside the `conditions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples are organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A combination experimentalist which aggregates additional measures from the component experimentalists.\n",
    "  - Where the measure is passed back in the conditions array, or\n",
    "  - Where the measure is passed back in a separate array\n",
    "- A combination experimentalist where the components need the full State  as they have complex arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toy Experimentalists\n",
    "\n",
    "We're combining experimentalists which samples conditions based on whether they are downvoted (or not)\n",
    "according to some criteria:\n",
    "- The \"Avoid Negative\" experimentalist, which downvotes conditions which have negative values (with one downvote per\n",
    "negative value in the conditions $x_i$: if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are negative, the condition gets 2 downvotes, and so\n",
    "on) and returns all the conditions in the \"preferred\" order (fewest downvotes first),\n",
    "- The \"Avoid Even\" experimentalist, which downvotes conditions which are closer to even numbers more (with one downvote\n",
    "per even value in the conditions and half a downvote if a condition is $1/2$ away from an even number) and returns all the conditions in the \"preferred\" order,\n",
    "- The \"Avoid Repeat\" experimentalist, which downvotes conditions which have already been seen based on the number of\n",
    "times a condition has been seen and returns all the conditions in the \"preferred\" order,\n",
    "- The \"Combine Downvotes\" experimentalist, which sums the downvotes of the others and returns the top $n$ \"preferred\"\n",
    "conditions\n",
    "(with the fewest downvotes); in the case of a tie, it returns conditions the order of the original conditions list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to see what happens when we:\n",
    "- Try to extend a dataframe with an extra data frame which has new columns."
